# The Shoppies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed for the Shopify 2021 Summer UX/Web Developer application. This application allows the user to add and remove movies to a nomination list from the search results. Search results are updated as the search term is updated. It also includes shareable links to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and email.

To try this application, you can go [here](https://edwin-do-shoppies.netlify.app/).

## Installation

Run the following commands:

Clone this repo into 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwin-do/shoppies.git

Create a file '.env' in the src folder and input your api key as follows.

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
